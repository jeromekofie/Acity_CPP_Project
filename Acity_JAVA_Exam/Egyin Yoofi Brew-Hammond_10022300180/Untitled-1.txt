DRAFT OF MY CODING PLAN.

JAVA GUI FOR A GPA CALCULATOR
CREATE A JFRAME GPA CALCULATOR
ENTER STUDENT NAME, ID,CREDIT HOURS,GRADES COMBOBOX TO SELECT FILE(PREFERRED STORAGE IS FILE)
CALCULATE GPA TO COMPUTE RESULT
SAVE FILES IN  GPA_RECORDS.TXT
"DATABASE UNDER CONSTRUCTION CODE"

GPA CALCS / NUMBERS ARE GRADE POINTS
A =4.0
B+3.5
B = 3.0
C+=2.5
C=2.0
D=1.5

GPA = E(GRADE POINTS X CREDIT HOURS)/ E(CREDIT HOURS)

SEND ALL STUDENT DETAILS TO THE CHOSEN OPTION WHICH IS FILE IN MY CASE

ONE SAVE OPTION FOR FILE
PLACEHOLDER MESSAGE

EV CRITERIA:
GUI DESIGN 5 MARKS
JAVA CONCEPTS 5 MARKS
GPA CALCULATION 3 MARKS
FILE SAVING 5 MARKS
SAVE OPTION 4 MARKS
SENDING DATA 3 MARKS
ERROR HANDLING 3 MARKS


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
MY IDEA is to create a simple gui that allows input and calculates and display gpa with details in txt completely.using netbeans

IF ONE OR MORE VALUES ARE ENTERED WRONGLY THE APPLICATION MUST PROMPT THE USER
CALCULATED GPA MUST SHOW IN TXT FILE

public class is GPACalculator
textbox for name and id in one section
course panel for unlimited entry of courses
theres a button for add, remove, calculate,save and view
label for gpa and title
array list for courses
set decimal for 0.00

color schemes are 0,102,204 for blue
240,240,240 for light grey
255,153,0 for orange

LABEL FOR NAME
LABEL FOR STUDENT ID
TEXT FIELD FOR BOTH
COURSE CREDIT HOUR AND GRADE INPUT SECTION (CREDIT HOURS SHOULD BE IN A DROPDOWN AND BE BETWEEN 1 AND 6)
GRADE SHOULD ALSO BE IN A DROP DOWN FROM A TO F
TEXT FIELD FOR COURSE SHOULD ALLOW BOTH NUMBERS AND LETTERS INCASE A USER DECIDES TO INPUT A COURSE CODE WITH MULTIPLE NUMBERS EG; ( CS IT 2238)
TITLE OF PAGE = StUDENT GPA Calculator IN BLACK
HEADER PANEL IN BLACK
MAINCONTENT PANEL IN BLACK 
IN SHORT EVERYTHING IS BLACK 
ADD COURSE BUTTON AND REMOVE COURSE BUTTON(RED)

THERES A BUTTON TO REMOVE COURSE INCASE AN ERROR HAS BEEN MADE DURING THE INPUT PHASE
GPA SHOWS UNDER ADD AND REMOVE COURSE BUTTON IN DIFFERENT COLOURS BASED ON PERFORMANCE TO BEAUTIFY THE OVERALL FORMAT
THE BACKGROUND BEING BLACK ALLOWS FOR VISIBLE CHANGE WHEN MORE COURSES KEPT BEING ADDED

CALCULATE GPA COMPUTES VALUES SAVE OVERWRITES THE TXT FILE AND VIEW SHOWS YOU THE OVERWRITTEN FILE WITH ALL DETAILS


CHANGED FROM ALL BLACK TO GRAY ACCENTS

MADE REFERENCE FOR COLOR SCHEMEING
