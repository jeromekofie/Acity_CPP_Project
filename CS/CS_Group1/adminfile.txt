This is going to be our personal workspace where well be able to discuss / put some miscellaneous details we want to say or do without putting it in the actual code : 

Cyril : 
    - i need to make a class where it will get the user information about the new tasks with description , priority and deadlines. 
        {
            - i have made the class file for the getting and setting of the task information , its called task.h which contains all variable declaration as well as the enums 
            - i have made the class implementation file where it sets the priority levels with the enums and its in the task.cpp file

            - i am about to make the task management class file as well as its implementation file
        }


i finished : {
    This implementation provides:
        A Task class with priority levels (LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH)
        A TaskManager class that handles task operations
        File-based storage of tasks
        A menu-driven interface
        Complete task management functionality including:
        Adding new tasks
        Viewing all tasks
        Marking tasks as completed
        Removing tasks
        Automatic saving/loading of tasks

    The program uses:
        Enums for task priorities
        File I/O for persistent storage
        Do-while loops for the menu system
        For loops for task iteration
        Vector for task storage
        Proper error handling and input validation

}


errors or bugs faced : {
     - im getting errors from the main class file as well as the taskmanager class fine so fix that 
     - The new information is not being uploaded to the file 
     - i get into an infinite loop any time the software isnt closed 
}




RESTART V3 : 

Task Management project. 

i have figured out the main file problem but i am now going to separate the classes for the priority and the date

- Kwame please make the files for the priority and the date 



issues faced : im getting this "Error converting priority or due date: stoi" but i think the error is where the compiler is not being able to convert the data type necessarily but will still run the code  as it says task completed







Kwame : 
i am going to  make the classes for the priority and the date 
- Cyril im done making the code for the priority and the date,
