# Acity_CPP_Project
Final report on health profile management system using C++
I have come to the end of my project The r1 r2 r3 files have a working code for the project I added extra features to enhance the efficiency of the program and to make it more user-interactive I took into consideration the design so as to make it more user-friendly clear instructions are given where user input is taken Also, the project made detailed use of input validations to ensure that users enter right paramters Header guards were used to prevent redefinitions of files I made use of getters and setters to allow smooth flow of code I divided the project into three files Two files include classes that focuses on just the profile and the other on the management of the profile Also made use of switch statments to allow user to choose options they want to work on Do-while, while and for loops were also implemented in this project Made use of escape sequences as well as variable declarations There was a clear implementation of menu-driven concepts What's more is the conscious use of comments to make easy reading and debugging the code There was use of vectors as well If-else statements were also used
There were also use of functions to make the code more efficient and easier to read. The code was also tested
Also , constructors and encapsulation were used. Made use of break and continue statements. Used \n \t escape sequences. 
Also made use of parameters for function definitions. 

What is unique?
My health profile manager not only keeps track of patient health history it also has a system of making recommendations based on user input
There is a thorough implementaion of input validation system that makes sure that users enter values within defined ranges
There is enough vital information required from patient that makes it even easier for doctors to track your health progress
Modular Design: By dividing the program into two separate classes (Profile and Health_Information), the code is modular and easier to maintain. The Profile class focuses on storing basic profile information (like the name), while Health_Information deals with health-related data.

#Explained in the code
the unique implementation of file handling that allows users to save and load their health profiles from a file.
